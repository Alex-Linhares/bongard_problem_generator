# Bongard

Bongard Problem grids (BPGs) can be used as the 'diagrams' in a variety of Bongard Problems I am currently exploring.

You can read more about what Bongard Problems are [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem)

The purpose of this project is to create a set of primitive operations and objects that can be used to evaluate if a BPG follows a given rule. I am working towards automatically generating rules and corresponding sets of BPGs. 

This code is very much a work in progress. Eventually I will package it into a ruby gem.
